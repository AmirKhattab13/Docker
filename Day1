## Problem 1
## Run the container hello-World
$ sudo docker run hello-world

## Check the container status
# To list all running containers on the Docker host
$ docker ps 
# To list all containers, including those that are not currently running
$ docker ps -a
# If you want to see more detailed information about a particular container
$ docker inspect CONTAINER ID

## Start the stopped container
$ docker start CONTAINER_ID
# You can use container name instead
$ docker start my_container

## Remove the container
$ docker rm CONTAINER_ID
# You can use container name instead
$ docker rm my_container
## To remove a running container, you must first stop it using the 'docker stop' command

## Remove the image
$ docker rmi IMAGE_ID
# You can use image name instead
$ docker rm my_image
## To remove an image that is in use, you must first stop and remove all containers that are using that image

## Problem 2
# Run container ubuntu in interactive mode 
$ docker run -it --name MyUbuntu ubuntu
# Run 'echo' in container
$ echo docker
# Run 'touch' in container
$ touch hello-docker
# Stop container and remove it, we can stop the container by using ctrl+d or the previous mentioned command
$ exit
$ docker rm MyUbuntu
## Note that the created file is permenantly deleted because the container doesn't have a volume or mount point
# Removing all the containers 
$ docker container prune

## Problem 3
# Run a container httpd with name apache and and attach a volume to the container containing static html file
# Make a mount point for the container and adding my name to static html file
$ mkdir /Mount
$ touch /Mount/index.html
$ echo 'Amir Khattab' > /Mout/index.html
# Run the container and mapping the port using -p and -d to make the container up and running
$ docker run -p 9898:80 -d --name apache -v /Mount/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs httpd
# Access the html file
$ curl http://localhost:9898
# Stop and remove the container
$ docker stop apache
$ docker rm apache
## The html file will not be removed and still you can access it
